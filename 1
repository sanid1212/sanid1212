Broken authentication occurs when the authentication process in a system is compromised, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionalities. One common scenario is when the password parameter is not properly validated, enabling attackers to bypass authentication measures and gain unauthorized entry.

Authentication is a crucial aspect of securing online systems, applications, or websites. It typically involves the verification of a user's identity through a combination of a username and password. When the authentication process is broken, it means that malicious actors can exploit vulnerabilities to gain access without the proper credentials.
