Title: Unauthorized Data Access via Swagger Endpoint Exploitation

Description:

A potential security vulnerability has been identified in the application's authentication mechanism, specifically related to concurrent logins and access controls. The application currently allows a user to be logged in with up to 5 concurrent sessions. However, beyond this limit, the application fails to enforce proper access controls, allowing an attacker to exploit the Swagger endpoint to gain unauthorized access to sensitive application data.

Details:

Concurrent Login Limitation: The application currently limits users to 5 concurrent logins, which is a reasonable security measure to prevent unauthorized access and ensure session management. However, the implementation of this limit is not consistently applied across all access points.

Access Control Failure: Upon reaching the limit of 5 concurrent logins, the application does not properly enforce access controls for other entry points, such as the Swagger endpoint. This oversight allows an attacker to exploit the lack of proper restrictions and gain access to application data without the intended session management constraints.

Exploitation via Swagger: The Swagger endpoint, intended for API documentation and testing, becomes a potential avenue for unauthorized access. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability by logging into the Swagger interface, where the absence of session management controls allows them to bypass the concurrent login limitation and access sensitive application data.

Risk and Impact: The vulnerability poses a significant risk as it enables unauthorized users to access and potentially manipulate sensitive data within the application. Depending on the nature of the data, this could lead to privacy breaches, data tampering, or other malicious activities that could impact the integrity and confidentiality of the application.

Recommendations:

Enforce Access Controls Consistently: Implement robust access controls across all entry points, including Swagger, to ensure that the concurrent login limitation is uniformly enforced.

Enhance Session Management: Improve session management mechanisms to accurately track and restrict user sessions, preventing unauthorized access regardless of the entry point.

Audit Swagger Configuration: Review and update the Swagger configuration to include proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring that it aligns with the application's overall security posture.

Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits, including penetration testing, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the application's authentication and access control mechanisms.

Update Documentation: Ensure that application documentation highlights the proper usage of authentication mechanisms and advises against exploiting the Swagger endpoint for unauthorized access.

Immediate Action:

Temporarily restrict access to the Swagger endpoint and conduct a thorough security review to mitigate the risk posed by this vulnerability. Implement the recommended measures to address the identified issues and enhance the overall security posture of the application.
