The application employs Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) technology for distributing its thick client application to users. With JNLP, the client application dynamically downloads required resources, including JAR files, from the server upon launch. However, a critical vulnerability exists where all application files, including JAR files, can be downloaded without requiring authentication. This oversight poses a severe security risk as it allows unauthorized users to retrieve the application's components, potentially facilitating reverse engineering attacks.
