The application improperly handles concurrent login restrictions by displaying an "already logged in" message when an incorrect password is entered. This indicates that the concurrent login check is performed before validating credentials, which can lead to information disclosure and potential security risks. An attacker can exploit this behavior to determine active sessions, enabling targeted attacks. To mitigate this, the application should validate credentials before enforcing concurrent login restrictions and ensure consistent error messaging for incorrect login attempts.
