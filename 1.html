The vulnerability involves the unauthenticated downloading of Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) files, potentially exposing sensitive application details and resources to unauthorized users. JNLP files are used to launch Java-based applications from a web server, typically accompanied by additional resources such as JAR files containing application code.
