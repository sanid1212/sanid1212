Description:
The application is equipped with SMB services that are running on ports 135 and 145, which are traditionally used for Windows RPC and SMB over NetBIOS communication, respectively. These services have a vulnerability that results in the inadvertent disclosure of user and group names, potentially exposing sensitive information about the application's user base.

Attack Vector:

An attacker scans for open ports and discovers the SMB services running on ports 135 and 145 of the affected application.
The attacker utilizes SMB enumeration techniques to query the application's SMB services for user and group information.
The SMB services, without proper access control and configuration, disclose user and group names, allowing the attacker to gather valuable intelligence about the application's user identities and group affiliations.
Impact:
Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to the exposure of usernames and group names used within the application. While this information might not directly provide authentication credentials or access to the application, it could aid attackers in planning more targeted attacks, such as social engineering or phishing campaigns, that leverage the disclosed user and group names.

Mitigation:
To mitigate this vulnerability and prevent the unintended disclosure of user and group names, the application administrators should consider the following actions:

Access Control Configuration: Configure access control settings for SMB services to limit the information that can be accessed. Restrict queries that retrieve user and group details to authorized users only.

Firewall Rules: Implement firewall rules that restrict external access to ports 135 and 145, especially if these services are not necessary for the application's intended functionality.

Disable Unnecessary Services: If SMB services are not required for the application's functionality, consider disabling them entirely to eliminate the associated risks.

SMB Hardening: Follow security best practices for hardening SMB services, including disabling NetBIOS over TCP/IP, enforcing secure authentication mechanisms, and implementing proper access controls.

Network Segmentation: Consider segmenting the application's network to limit the exposure of sensitive services to potential attackers.

Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including unintended information disclosure.

User Education: Educate users about the potential risks associated with information disclosure and encourage them to be vigilant against social engineering attacks.

Vendor Response:
The vulnerability has been reported to the vendor, and they are investigating the issue. Users are advised to follow the mitigation steps provided above until an official patch or fix is released. Regularly monitor the vendor's security advisories for updates.
